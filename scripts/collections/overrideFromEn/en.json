The fertiliser increases resistance to the direct effects of frost. In addition, minerals and trace elements have been added to the fertiliser granules. Autumn Fertiliser All-In-One granules ensure that your lawn and plants are dark green, strong, and winter-hardy. This high-quality nutrition has an indirect effect on moss and weeds. The odourless fertiliser granules are enriched with easily absorbable nitrogen and potassium (NPK 6-2-12). Thanks to the long-lasting effect (+100 days), there will still be enough nutrients for good regrowth of the grass and the formation of a strong, dense turf in which moss and weeds have no chance, even after scarifying. This results in a healthy, strong turf that is better able to withstand wear, drought, and frost. The effectiveness of autumn fertiliser is often underestimated. By ensuring that grass enters the winter strong and hardened, problems in the spring are prevented.",

Frassor insect frass in this product comes from the larvae of the black soldier fly.

Frassor enriches and processes the frass into high-quality natural fertilisers.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Nourishes the soil life</h2>\nA healthy soil life begins with insects. These efficient creatures maintain an ecological balance in nature. The residues left by the insects, such as excrements and skin sheds, are rich in chitin and used as raw material for Frassor. This organic fertiliser ensures that soil water and nutrients are retained, making them available in the soil for a longer period. The result is a healthier soil with sufficient nutrients available even during drier periods. Chitin serves as a food source for beneficial soil organisms and supports plant and soil resilience.\n<h2>Chitin – Stimulates antagonistic activity, resulting in increased plant and soil resilience</h2>\nFrassor is highly abundant in chitin. Chitin serves as a superfood for microorganisms that break it down. During this process, enzymes are released (chitinases) that trigger the plant to activate its natural defense mechanisms. As a result, the crop becomes less attractive to diseases and pests. It's no wonder that Frassor is successfully applied in the horticulture sector.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>The best for the environment</h2>\nFrassor has the lowest CO2 footprint among all fertilisers! The production of artificial fertilisers consumes a lot of energy, leading to significant CO2 emissions. Additionally, artificial fertilisers have a negative impact on all life in the soil and leach out quickly. Compared to other organic fertilisers like cow, chicken, and pig manure, Frassor insect frass has a considerably lower CO2 footprint.

This Lawn Topdressing Mix restores the soil and prevents problems. Soil life provides buffering of nutrients, making them available when the grass needs them. By activating and introducing active soil life, not only the grass is fed, but also the soil.\n\nGrass lives in symbiosis with fungi and bacteria\nWith this Lawn Topdressing Mix, living Mychorizza fungi and Rhizobacteria are introduced and activated, among others. Positive soil life such as worms and fungi form tunnels in the ground, allowing air, organic material, and other nutrients to be distributed through the soil. Dead plant material is processed into nutritious raw material by composters. This Lawn Topdressing Mix is successfully used in practice to stimulate healthy soil life. Especially in the area around plant roots, the so-called rhizosphere, millions of fungi and bacteria live, exchanging nutrients with each other and plants, making each other's lives better.\n\nPositive micro-life serves the plant, which in turn offers sugars. A healthy soil life contains thousands of different bacteria, fungi, and enzymes that cooperate in a certain way for mutual benefit. Certain bacteria neutralize dangerous substances such as heavy metals. The added Azotobacter bacterium extracts nitrogen from the air and exchanges it for sugars with the plant. Other microorganisms break down dead plant material and convert it into absorbable nutrients. Some attack pathogens, while important fungi help to extract nutrients deeper from the soil. Added Bacillus bacteria promote root growth and increase resistance to pathogens. In short, the soil is alive! A healthy ecosystem is crucial. Lawn Topdressing Mix brings the soil into balance, supports positive soil life, and increases plant and soil resistance. In a healthy soil, healthy plants grow, leaving no room for diseases and pests.\n\nLava meal is rich in essential minerals and trace elements.\nMany soils have a shortage of minerals and trace elements, causing processes in the soil and plants not to run optimally. This Lawn Topdressing Mix is enriched with high-quality Organifer lava meal, which replenishes essential minerals and trace elements. This naturally makes the soil more fertile.\n\nWorm castings\nOrganifer worm castings are considered the best of the best. It is a natural improver based on composted plant residues, providing an optimal balance in the soil so the plant can grow and flourish. Worm castings contain everything a plant really needs: a very high organic content (humus) and a multitude of trace elements, enzymes, minerals, bacteria, and fungi. Humus-rich soil holds nutrients better. Combined with worm castings, bacteria and fungi can thrive and the soil structure will improve considerably.\n\nNutrition for healthy and vital grass\nBy mixing in dried cow manure, not only is the soil improved, but also immediately available nutrition is provided. This organic fertilizer has a long-lasting effect. The fertilizer nourishes the soil and ensures a rich, healthy soil. This promotes balanced growth and gives the grass a good structure. An organic fertilizer is an energy source for bacteria and is converted into humus. Humus provides a good soil structure and promotes natural processes.

    "description": "Organifer Insect Frass Fertilizer Pellets are made from 100% pure insect droppings sourced from larvae of the Black Soldier Flies. It is a high-quality product manufactured in the Netherlands, dried and sanitized through heating, and then compressed into unique micro-pellets.\n\nOrganifer Frass is highly abundant in chitin. Chitin is a superfood for microorganisms that break it down. During this process, enzymes (chitinases) are released, prompting the plant to activate its natural defense mechanisms. This makes the plant less susceptible to diseases and pests. It is no wonder that Organifer insect fertilizer is successfully used in the horticulture industry.",

    "description": "Due to intensive use, the quality of our soils is constantly under pressure. The decades-long use of artificial fertilisers limited to a few elements has depleted the soil. The mineral fertility decreases, the humus content, structure, and disease resistance of the soil decline. As a result, plants have less resistance, and our food has become poorer in essential minerals and trace elements.\n\nBy only using artificial fertilisers, lime, and organic matter, soils cannot sustainably recover. The use of rock dust as a natural source of minerals to increase soil fertility has been known for a long time but has been neglected due to the focus on modern synthetic fertilisers.\n\nSince 2009, Organifer has been committed to sustainable soil quality restoration.",
